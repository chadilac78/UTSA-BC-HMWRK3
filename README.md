# UTSA-BC-HMWRK3

HOMEWORK 3
CREATED HTML & CSS DOCUMENTS FOR ABOUT, PORTFOLIO AND CONTACT
THOUGHT PROCESS WAS IF I HAVE AN HTML AND CSS FILE FOR EACH PAGE IT WOULD BE EASIER TO IDENTIFY AND FIX
ANY BUGS IF EACH HTML PAGE HAD ITS OWN CSS FILE
ADDED LG NAVBAR (DARK) W/ BRAND "CHADRICK WORTHAN" COLAPSES TO HAMBURGER MENU WHEN SCREEN IS SHRUNK
USED ROW/COL FUNCTION FOR PORTFOLIO CARDS
3 CARDS SPAN 4 COLUMNS, REMAINING CARDS WRAP TO NEXT ROW (6 TOTAL)
ADDED BACKGROUND IMAGES TO ALL 3 PAGES
ADDED JS SCRIPT TO MAKE HAMBURGER MENU FUNCTION PROPERLY
CONTACT PAGE HAS FORM ENTRIES, DEFINED TYPES OF ENTRY (TEXT, EMAIL AND ADDED TEXT AREA FOR MESSAGE)
